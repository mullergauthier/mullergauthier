-👋 Hey , it's Gauthier, from Ribeauvillé in Alsace (s'gilt!)
After having followed an industrial engineering cursus⚙️ up to a Masters degree, I've increase my knowledge with management training. Following my internship, I managed an artisanal bakery pastry with 20 people for 7 years.

At the end of 2019, I decided to reorient myself towards a more promising field and closer to my areas of interest. Starting by doing some Mooc to get back to level (networks, programming languages, stats), I finished the Data Analyst 📊 training of OpenClassrooms. Today, graduated, here I am embarked in the jungle!

Outside of Data? I am a beer lover that I brew in 30 L batches 🍺, I co-organize cultural exchange evenings 🎤, I try to dive as soon as I can and I photograph what makes me vibrate 📷.

My strength:
Autonomy, curiosity, adaptability
